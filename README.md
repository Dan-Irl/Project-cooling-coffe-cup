# Project cooling coffe cup

In this project the cooling process of a coffee cup is simulated. This is done by setting up an equations system for the heat and mass balances of the system and then numerically solving it using MATLAB ODE solver ODE45.

All files necessary to run the code are in the project but some toolboxes may be required.
